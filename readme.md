`node index.js` streams the entire texts of Romeo and Juliet and The Iliad, separates them into training data and test data, and creates a Bayes classifier that can predict with 89% accuracy the text to which a given string belongs. 

The rest of this is my notes on the `natural` module from following the NLP tutorial on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/natural-language-processing-in-javascript-with-natural).
